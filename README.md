## üöÄ Running the Project
### 1. Prerequisites:
- **JDK 17:** Install JDK 17.
- **MySQL:** Install and run MySQL server locally.
- **Maven:** Install Maven.
- **Google Account:** Needed for email configuration (if you want to use this feature).
- **Postman:** You'll need Postman to test the API of the application. If you don't have it, download and install Postman.

### 2. Configure MySQL Database:
- Ensure that you have MySQL installed and running on port 3306.
- Create a database. You can name it anything, but for this example, we are using the name cvenjoyer. If you prefer a different name, modify the configuration in the application.properties file accordingly.

- To create the database, run the following query in MySQL:
- **CREATE DATABASE cvenjoyer;**
- If you decide to use a different database name, remember to update the spring.datasource.url value in the application.properties file to reflect the correct database name:
- **spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name**

### 3. Configure application.properties File:
- **In the application.properties file (found in src/main/resources), input the following configuration values:**

### 4. Generating an Application-Specific Password for Gmail:
- If you are using Gmail for email sending, you must generate an application-specific password in your Google account. Here‚Äôs how:
- Log in to your Google account.
- Open the Google Account Management page.
- In the address bar of your browser, enter the following URL:
- **https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords**
- Log in again if prompted.
- Select the application (e.g., "Mail") and device (e.g., "Windows computer") and click Generate.
- Copy the generated application password.
- Paste this password into the application.properties file in the spring.mail.password field.

### 5. Build and Run the Application:
- Once all the files are configured and values are set, go to the project‚Äôs root directory and build the application by running the following command in your terminal:
- **mvn clean package**

- After the build process is complete, run the application with the following command:
- **mvn spring-boot:run**
- The application should now be running locally on port 8080 (by default). To begin testing its features:
- In the Browser: Go to http://localhost:8080/api to check if the application is working properly.
- In Postman: Open Postman and test the various API endpoints. Remember, some endpoints require authentication, so you‚Äôll need to add the JWT token in the request header:
- In Postman, go to the Authorization tab, choose Bearer Token, and paste your JWT token in the Token field.
- Now you can begin testing the application in Postman by making requests to the available endpoints.

### 6. Testing User Features:
- **Register a New User:**

If you don't have an account yet, you must first register a new user. After registration, you will be able to log in and get your JWT Bearer token.

User Registration Example
![User Registration](https://imgur.com/gykgK06)
*Screenshot showing the user registration process.*

- **Log In:**

After registering, log in with your user credentials. You will receive a JWT Bearer token.

User Login Example

*Screenshot showing the user login process.*

- **Include the Bearer Token:**

Important: Remember to include the Bearer token in the Authorization header of your requests where required to access the features of the application.

## üö® Troubleshooting Email Sending Endpoint
- **If you encounter issues with the email sending endpoint, it is possible that your antivirus or firewall is blocking the connection to the Gmail SMTP server. In that case, try temporarily disabling your antivirus software or firewall and test again.**

- **Note: Some security software may block outgoing SMTP traffic, which can prevent email functionality from working properly. Disabling the antivirus or firewall can help resolve this issue during testing.**
